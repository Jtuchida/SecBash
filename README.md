# SecBash
Bash Script developed to provide security checks on a Linux system (giving access to specific vital security checks)

This script was developed by students new to Linux, learning the ropes.
The objective was to dive into the Linux system and understand some of the key factor in hardening a Linux systems.

What has been created here is a way for those that are still new to the Linux OS to be able to run basic security checks on their existing or new system to determine what security is required to be fortified. By creating a makeshift GUI different options are given to run a variety of system scans, display operation commands, and also anti-malware protocls to possible detect any hidden malware on the system. 

Each option is labeled to its purpose and runs commands and protcols automatically ensuring that the opertation is done correctly leaving less worry (when it comes to new and "still learing" users)

The script is not only able to be transported and used on any given Linux system at any given time, but also is able to be modified very easily to achieve any operations a more seasoned user may be inclined to use on their system. While this project is a first time developmenet and proof of concept, i.e. to simulate other GUIs for security protcols as other OSs, like Windows with "Windows Defender Firewall", but made for Linux, it has been made to be modular and simple to take apart and understand.

*This script was a a group project along with the students Zach Walker and Susan Webb*
